# Simple-Light-Switch
This was my first project ever done myself with HTML, CSS, and javascript. It's very simple but poorly made. this project was built on October 18th, 2020

Github wants me to add a readme.  i still dont fully understand github but im learning. this "project" is simple and is here for future reference.
